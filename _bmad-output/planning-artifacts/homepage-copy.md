# Suflate – Homepage Positioning & Conversion Copy

## 1. Primary Goal of Homepage

Convert first-time visitors into **activated users** by making three things instantly clear:

1. What Suflate does
2. Who it is for
3. Why it is fundamentally different from other LinkedIn tools

The homepage must reduce skepticism around AI, highlight authenticity, and drive users to try voice-first creation immediately.

## 2. Hero Section (Above the Fold)

### Primary Headline

**Turn how you think into LinkedIn posts — using your voice.**

### Subheadline

Record your thoughts. Suflate turns them into publish-ready LinkedIn posts that sound like *you* — not AI.

### Primary CTA

**🎙 Record your first post**

### Secondary CTA

See how it works (30s demo)

### Trust Cue (Small Text)

No typing. No prompts. No generic AI voice.

---

## 3. Problem Validation Section

### Headline

You don't have a content problem. You have a *writing* problem.

### Copy

You have ideas.
You have opinions.
You even know what you want to say.

But when it's time to write a LinkedIn post — everything slows down.

Most tools assume you're a writer.
Suflate is built for people who think out loud.

## 4. How Suflate Works (3 Steps)

### Step 1 – Speak

Talk naturally for up to 3 minutes.
No scripts. No structure.

### Step 2 – Shape

Suflate structures your thoughts into multiple LinkedIn-ready posts — while preserving your voice.

### Step 3 – Post

Edit if you want.
Post to LinkedIn with one click.

## 6. Authenticity Proof Section

### Headline

This sounds like you — because it starts with you.

### Copy

AI tools usually guess your voice.
Suflate doesn't need to.

Your voice is the input.
The AI only helps organize and polish — never rewrite who you are.

### Visual Idea

Before: raw transcript
After: clean LinkedIn post (same words, clearer structure)

---

## 7. Editing & Control Section

### Headline

You're always in control.

### Copy

Edit every word.
Tweak the hook.
Fix grammar.
Shorten or expand.

Suflate never posts anything without your approval.

---

## 8. Who Suflate Is For

### Headline

Built for people who think faster than they type

### Personas

* Consultants & coaches
* Founders & operators
* Freelancers & solo creators
* Agencies & ghostwriters

### Explicit Exclusion (Subtle)

If you love writing long posts from scratch, you probably don't need Suflate.

---

## 9. Social Proof (Early-Stage Friendly)

### Placeholder Copy

"Finally, a tool that sounds like me."

"Feels like my thoughts — just clearer."

"Posting doesn't feel heavy anymore."

---

---
