# Suflate – First-Time User Experience (FTUX)

## Goal of FTUX

Design the first **10 minutes** of Suflate so that a new user reaches a clear emotional and functional outcome:

> **"This sounds exactly like me — and I can publish without effort."**

The FTUX must minimize cognitive load, remove decision fatigue, and deliver a publish-ready LinkedIn post as fast as possible.

---

## Success Criteria (FTUX)

* User records a voice note within 60 seconds of signup
* User sees at least one generated post they feel confident publishing
* User understands they can edit everything
* User understands posting is connected to LinkedIn

---

## Step-by-Step FTUX Flow

### 1. Welcome Screen (0–30s)

**Purpose:** Reduce anxiety, set expectations, invite action.

**Copy:**

> "Say it. We'll help you post it."

**Subtext:**

> "Record your thoughts — Suflate turns them into LinkedIn posts that sound like you."

**Primary CTA:**

* **Record your first post**

No dashboards. No features. No setup.

---

### 2. Voice Recording Screen (30–90s)

**Purpose:** Get raw input immediately.

**UI:**

* Large microphone button
* Timer (max 3:00)
* Minimal guidance text

**Prompt (optional):**

> "What's something you learned recently? Or an opinion you have?"

**Actions:**

* Tap to record
* Tap to stop
* Playback available

---

### 3. Processing State (90–120s)

**Purpose:** Build trust while AI works.

**Microcopy:**

* "Transcribing your voice…"
* "Structuring your thoughts…"
* "Preserving your voice…"

Avoid technical terms like "LLM" or "API".

---

### 4. Generated Posts Screen (2–4 min)

**Purpose:** Deliver the Aha moment.

**Layout:**

* 3–5 post variations
* Each clearly labeled (e.g. Story / Lesson / Opinion)

**User Reaction Goal:**

> "That's exactly how I talk."

**Primary Actions per post:**

* Edit
* Fix grammar
* Tighten hook
* Shorten

---

### 5. Editing Experience (4–7 min)

**Purpose:** Reinforce authorship and control.

**Editor Rules:**

* Inline text editing
* No auto-changes without user action

**AI Assist Buttons:**

* Fix grammar
* Make clearer
* Shorten
* Keep my voice

**Visual Cue:**

> "You're always in control."

---

### 6. Connect LinkedIn (7–8 min)

**Purpose:** Remove posting friction.

**Copy:**

> "Connect LinkedIn to post with one click."

**What happens:**

* LinkedIn OAuth
* Explain clearly:

  * "We open LinkedIn with your post ready — you click Post."

Trust-first language.

---

### 7. Post Action (8–10 min)

**Primary CTA:**

* **Post on LinkedIn**

**Behavior:**

* Redirect to LinkedIn composer
* Post pre-filled

**Fallback:**

* "Copy & post later"

---

## Key Design Principles

* One primary action per screen
* No feature exposure before first post
* Mobile-first always
* Fast perceived speed

---

## FTUX Anti-Patterns to Avoid

* Dashboards on first login
* Asking for niche preferences early
* Prompt engineering screens
* Feature tours

## Emotional Journey Summary

| Minute | Emotion     |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 0–1    | Curious     |
| 1–2    | Comfortable |
| 2–4    | Surprised   |
| 4–7    | Confident   |
| 7–10   | Empowered   |

---

## FTUX Outcome

If FTUX succeeds, the user leaves thinking:

> "I can finally show up on LinkedIn without forcing myself to write."

This experience becomes the foundation for retention and referrals.
